&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to electricity and modern cooking fuels, especially for women, leads to time savings in the home, improved health and better access to information. These factors increase women’s well-being and enhance their ability to make reproductive choices, which is empirically expressed by falling birth rates. This study provides an international analysis of the relationship between access to modern energy and fertility, based on panel data synthesized from 155 Demographic and Health Surveys over 26 years. Controlling for other determinants, we find that access to electricity and modern cooking fuels, along with education, negatively affects fertility. Energy and education effects are complementary and strongest in regions with initially high fertility rates. Expanded access to modern energy and education would accelerate the demographic transition. Therefore, the energy demand and carbon emissions needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of energy access while ensuring gender equality and climate action would be lower in the long term than currently assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is the 8th of March 2021, it&amp;rsquo;s international women&amp;rsquo;s day, and I want to tell you you about forced and uninformed sterilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Reproductive rights&amp;rdquo; are the rights of individuals to decide whether to reproduce and have reproductive health. They are a  fundamental human right, yet far from being achieved at the global level. Although men may also suffer from a lack of reproductive rights, it is mainly women who are deprived of this fundamental right by systems of patriarchal oppression, at institutional, community and/or private levels. According to data from 57 countries across the world, about 45% of women globally are not able to say no to sex, decide on their own health care or decide on their contraception [1]. Forced sterilization is a particularly outrageous violation to women&amp;rsquo;s reproductive rights. It consist in women being operated without knowing the purpose of the operation. They were told, for example, that they had to have an operation on their appendix [2] while doctors were removing their womb or ligating their fallopian tubes. Yes, just like dogs. Even more horrific, forced sterilizations were often organized by an official institution, to control the reproduction of women, often women of color, poor or disabled women. As a women I find no words to describe what I feel when I hear those stories. It makes me want to investigate more about this and start an effort of collecting comprehensive information about these awful crimes. However, to my knowledge no comprehensive global database exist on forced sterilization, which makes it, in my view a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;missing dataset&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dhsprogram.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DHS data&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful source of data about demography and health. They are harmonized across countries and waves, which makes them easily comparable across countries. In addition, the samples are nationally (and sub-nationally) representative for the population. I recently discovered that they were collecting data on sterilization. Specifically, they collected information, for women who had been sterilized, on whether the woman had been informed that the operation meant she could not have children any more. In my opinion, this sounds terrible enough to be called forced sterilization, but I will call it &amp;ldquo;uninformed sterilization&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I calculated the share of women, in each available countries, that had been through &amp;ldquo;uninformed sterilization&amp;rdquo;. For those who may wonder, I used DHS weights to re-store the representativity of the sample. The code and the data is available on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/belmin/uninformed_sterilization&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this git repository&lt;/a&gt;.
Once I had this indicator, namely the share of women that had gone through &amp;ldquo;uninformed sterilization&amp;rdquo; for each survey, I meaned over countries to obtain only one value per country. For information, I only used surveys from 2000 to 2010. I then divided the values into quintiles to map it on a world map below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see that &amp;ldquo;uninformed sterilization&amp;rdquo; are quite common in India, Bangladesh, Colombia, Nicaragua, Honduras (all above 15 women per 1000). But when were these women sterilized? Forced sterilization are often said to be something from the past, something that neo-Malthusian were obsessed about in the 1970s, in order to alleviate the &amp;ldquo;population problem&amp;rdquo;, or something that Nazis undertook in the 1930s. However, this is something that has still happened recently, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/30/california-prisons-forced-sterilizations-belly-beast&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;even in a country like the US&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to explore this in this data, in the case of uninformed sterilizations. As the DHS data&amp;rsquo;s samples are women aged from 15 to 49, these sterilizations above may have occurred long ago (which does not make it less scandalous though). To have an estimation of the year in which these women were sterilized, I used the age at which they were sterilized (it was an age group), their age at the time of the survey, and the survey year to compute the estimated sterilization year.
I then plotted the number of women, from these surveys, who had been sterilized, per year. I think one should not analyze the trend, as the trends highly depends on many things the simple analysis cannot control for (the age structure of each population, the survey years, the sterilization rate over time etc). But this plot shows, most importantly, that uninformed sterilization were still happening recently.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still a lot to be investigated in this data. Who were these women? From which ethnical, religious or socio-economic background were they? What was their level of education? What age were they when they were sterilized?
How to use best this data to show the world that reproductive rights are being widely violated, still today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: The estimates may hold a relatively high uncertainty, especially for countries with low rates. Why? Although the DHS data allows to calculate nationally representative indicators, these uninformed sterilization are in some countries a relatively rare phenomenon. And the rarer the phenomenon, the more data should be collected to obtain a consistent estimation. But this is what we have. And in any case, it shows uninformed sterilization exists, still today, and this is outrageous.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wanted: a perfect reproducible paper workflow</title>
      <link>https://camillebelmin.github.io/post/reproducible-paper-writing/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://camillebelmin.github.io/post/reproducible-paper-writing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I submitted my first article as part of my PhD. This paper was written in R markdown and is fully reproducible. It means that a single document contains all the manuscript but also all the code for the analysis and figure generation. All the pre-processings are also reproducible and the code is available on my gitlab. I am pretty happy to contribute to reproducible science, and I hope that my code is user-friendly enough to enable other people using it. Truth is, it was not the most straightforward way to write the paper, and consumed a lot of time. It does not mean it wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth it, and that I would not do it again. However, I would like to improve this reproducible workflow and learn from other people&amp;rsquo;s experience. That is why I am writing this short post to talk about the workflow we adopted and the challenges associated with this workflow, and start to think about how we could do differently in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    The workflow adopted to write our reproducible paper, with a lot of back and forth from Word/Open Office to R markdown
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-workflow-we-adopted&#34;&gt;What is the workflow we adopted?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!--The tools used to write a quantitative paper depend on your co-author taste and familiarity with available tools. The best workflow for you is not necessarily the best for your colleagues, and the other way around. One has to adapt and find a common ground. When all the authors on your paper are not very familiar or confortable with writing in R markdown, or when you value track changes as part of the workflow, making a fully reproducible paper might not be the most efficient way to write a paper.   

, but or when you value track changes as part of the learning process of writing, making a reproducible manuscript is probably not the most efficient way to write a paper. --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the figure above, I schematized the workflow we adopted for writing this paper. First, we iterated only on a word document (step 1) to be able to track the changes made by my co-authors. This allowed to have my sentences corrected and to improve my writing. After the draft was relatively mature, I created a R markdown (Rmd) file using the text we had come up with, together with all the code for the analysis and figure generation (step 2). From this point, the internal reviewing process worked as follows: I knited the Rmd to Word (step 3), then my co-authors would successively add changes and comment the draft (step 4). When they were all done, I then manually included their changes back in the Rmd file, mostly by overusing the &lt;em&gt;Ctrl + C&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ctrl + V&lt;/em&gt; commands (step 3). This was very time consuming. For each edit: I spotted the edit in word, copied the sentence, then I searched the exact location of the corresponding text in R markdown (Screenshot below), then paste it there. Then, in order not to loose track of the changes I already had included, I accepted the changes in the word document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    The process of integrating changes from a word document with track change to R markdown
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I repeated that for each changes, and for each the rounds of review (i.e. a lot of times, and a lot of headaches 🤯).&lt;/p&gt;






  



  
  











&lt;figure &gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://camillebelmin.github.io/post/reproducible-paper-writing/letsdoitagain_hu16fbb3eb9bac90a91a8413fecd9da511_983848_2000x2000_fit_lanczos.gif&#34; &gt;

&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was probably not the most intelligent/efficient way of proceeding, but once launched in the process, it was just easier to continue like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-alternative-workflows&#34;&gt;What are alternative workflows?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If track change is an absolute necessity (I tend to think so), I think the most obvious alternative is to use Word for the whole process, and to switch to R markdown &lt;em&gt;at the end&lt;/em&gt;. However, it is hard to know when is actually going to be the last round of edit and getting used to the Rmarkdown-word process (steps 3-4) can take some time. If the paper needs to be submitted before a deadline, this could become quite stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another solution is that co-authors add changes directly on the Rmd. This requires that all co-authors are comfortable with navigating in a Rmd document, with potentially a lot of code chunks. Rstudio will soon release [Visual Rstudio](&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/09/30/rstudio-v1-4-preview-visual-markdown-editing/&#34;&gt;https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/09/30/rstudio-v1-4-preview-visual-markdown-editing/&lt;/a&gt;), that provides a user friendly visual text editor and this will hopefully attract more people to R markdown (and reproducibility 😊!). For example, users can now see their content change in real-time as they write. It also highlights spelling mistakes as in Word/Libre Office writer, really nice! You can try the preview [here](&lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/&#34;&gt;https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/&lt;/a&gt;). Unfortunately, track change or comments are still not available in this version. It makes it difficult to keep track of changes in collaborative work. One solution would be to commit to a git repository and visualizing the difference between two files, but this seems like an overly complicated process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using one Word document to write the paper, and have a separate Rmd file containing all the analysis and figure generation in a Rmd file. Then, whenever the numbers/tables/figures in the text needed to be updated, I would include them manually in the Word file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am aware that some R packages are being developed like redoc and reviewer. Unfortunately, the development of the former has now been suspended. Regarding reviewer, I have not tried it. My feeling is that people reluctant to using R or R markdown would have difficulty engaging with the method they propose. If you have a good experience with it, I would be happy to hear your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However I find that all of these workflow are imperfect for me, and I am still looking in search&amp;hellip; If you have alternative solutions, please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bottom-line&#34;&gt;Bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tools used to write a reproducible quantitative paper depend on your co-authors&#39; respective tastes and their familiarity with available tools. The best workflow for you is not necessarily the best for your colleagues, and the other way around. One has to adapt and find a common ground, and also probably experience different workflows to see what fits best, under which circumstances. I am still looking for the perfect reproducible workflow, given the constrains that most of my colleagues are not necessarily familiar with writing in R markdown, and that I value track changes as part of the writing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about you?&lt;/strong&gt; I would be interested to hear about experience from people who have written reproducible papers. What was your workflow? Was it efficient? What were your constraints? Would you recommend it? Please share your story! ☺️&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A dataset of harmonized DHS districts</title>
      <link>https://camillebelmin.github.io/post/dhs-region-harmonization/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://camillebelmin.github.io/post/dhs-region-harmonization/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I present a dataset that I created, containing the
harmonized district names and regions of 254 demographic and health
surveys (DHS). I explain why I created it, how I did it and how to use
the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-the-need-for-an-harmonization-of-dhs-districts&#34;&gt;1. The need for an harmonization of DHS districts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DHS data are micro-datasets monitored by the the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dhsprogram.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DHS
Program&lt;/a&gt; (ICF 2017) (mainly USAID funded) since
1984. They cover more than 90 countries and 400 surveys. The DHS dataset
is a rich source of data for a large set of research topics such as
health, epidemiology, economy, demography or sociology. Local
authorities are responsible for implementing the survey in their own
countries but the methodology of DHS surveys is standardized, which
makes them even more useful when it comes to conducting cross-country
analyses. However, differences in the encoding of variables can still
occur. In particular, the reporting of region/district names is far from
being standardized. This can be due to differences in reporting
languages or simply typos. For example, a given region of a country can
be reported “Center” (US English) with the index 5 in year 1990, and
“Centre” (Brit., French) with the index 3 in 1995. Another type of
change in region index and names reporting can be due to a political
change of administrative sub-divisions (merging/splitting of regions or
complete re-definition of administrative sub-divisions). These
discontinuities can be a problem when one wants to create panel data set
for one or several countries, the unit of the panel being the
region/district. For my PhD project, I needed to build a panel data set
for the district level for as many DHS surveys (and therefore countries)
as I could. I therefore spent some time harmonizing the region names and
indices. I decided to share this dataset that I created and to explain
in this document how I built it and how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-how-did-i-create-the-dataset&#34;&gt;2. How did I create the dataset?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to create this dataset, I first loaded all the DHS datasets and kept only the information on DHS survey ID, region name and region index and I put it together in one single file. I then used four different types of methods of harmonization, and added a column &amp;ldquo;method_harmonization&amp;rdquo; to tell which method was used for each DHS survey. The four methods are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1- The most simple (but laborious) thing to do was to correct typos and
wrongly encoded region indices. For example, a region could have been
encoded “ATLANTique” in 2000 and “Atlantique” in 2005, or a difference
in the language could occur (for example North (English) and Nord
(French)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3- When no information was available from the IPUMS-DHS harmonization, I used the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://spatialdata.dhsprogram.com/home/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DHS spatial repository&lt;/a&gt;, which mapped the boundaries of sub-national regions in DHS surveys, over time. It allows to visualize change, merge or division of regions over time. Some specific notes on this harmonization can be found on the document 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/belmin/dhs_region_harmonization/-/blob/master/DHS_region_harmonization_files/notes_harmonization.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;notes_harmonization.md&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4- For a few surveys, I did the harmonization myself based on my own
research. For example, Uganda 2016, the regions of North Buganda and Souhth Buganda were put in the region Central 1 + Central 2 + Kampala because the Central region is coterminous with the Kingdom of Buganda, one of the ancient African monarchies that are constitutionally recognised in Uganda 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Uganda&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;. Further notes are available on the document 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/belmin/dhs_region_harmonization/-/blob/master/DHS_region_harmonization_files/notes_harmonization.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;notes_harmonization.md&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some surveys where removed in the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The countries that had only one wave of DHS survey because there was
no cause for harmonization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some surveys for which there was no harmonization possible. For
example when a country has two waves with very different
administrative sub-divisions, I didn’t know how to harmonize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some specific countries for which the number of region varies too
much across the waves (for example Dominican Republic)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the region name harmonization, I created two columns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;region_name_clean: here, I only corrected the typos, the change of
language of the region (i.e. Nord to North). I did not merge any
regions in this column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;region_name_harmonized: this column has cleaned column names and
also harmonized regions by sometimes changing the administrative
borders (following what the IPUMS-DHS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-the-dataset&#34;&gt;3. The dataset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dataset can be found on my git repository

&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/belmin/dhs_region_harmonization/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
Here is an extract of the dataset, for the country Benin, the year 2012
and
2017:&lt;/p&gt;

harmonization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-how-to-use-it&#34;&gt;4. How to use it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are working on a study involving several waves of DHS of a
country in which you need to aggregate the data at the sub-national
level, here is how to do to harmonize the region names and index using
my concordance dataset. The code below works with the package rdhs,
which is a package for the management and analysis of DHS data. To make
this code work, you’ll have to download the DHS data through the &lt;em&gt;rdhs&lt;/em&gt;
package. All the steps to do so are described 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rdhs/vignettes/introduction.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here (in “3. Download
survey
datasets”)&lt;/a&gt;.
(To ask for access to DHS data –&amp;gt; go to the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://dhsprogram.com/data/new-user-registration.cfm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DHS Program
website&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps to use my concordance dataset to harmonize the
regions names of the surveys in which you are interested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1- First of all, download the git repository, and check in the
dhs_harmonization_dataset.csv if the DHS surveys in which you are
interested have been harmonized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2- Load the meta-information on the DHS surveys for which you have
access granted: (For information, the correspondance between DHS country
code and country names can be found

&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/belmin/dhs_region_harmonization/tree/master/DHS_region_harmonization_files/DHS_country_code.csv&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;
library(dplyr)
library(reactable)

# Set the path of the git repository and of data folder
path_git_repo = getwd()
path_toy_dhs_data &amp;lt;- paste0(path_git_repo, &amp;quot;/DHS_region_harmonization_files/toy_DHS_data&amp;quot;)

# Select the country code of the country on which you which to work
country_code &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;BJ&amp;quot; # In this example we will mimic to use Benin data (although I am only using toy data)

# If you have access to the DHS data, Do this step: 
  ## Load the dataset with information on all the dhs surveys for which you have access granted
  # library(rdhs)
  # info_dhs_datasets &amp;lt;- 
  # rdhs::dhs_datasets(fileFormat = &amp;quot;spss&amp;quot;, fileType = &amp;quot;IR&amp;quot;, surveyType = &amp;quot;DHS&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
    #dplyr::select(SurveyId, SurveyYear, DHS_CountryCode, CountryName, FileName) %&amp;gt;% 
    #rename(zip_file_name = FileName) %&amp;gt;%
    #   mutate(rds_file_name = # create a column corresponding to the RDS file name instead of zip file name
      #         paste0(substr(zip_file_name, start=1, stop = 8 ),&amp;quot;.rds&amp;quot;))

# If you don&#39;t have access to the dhs data, run this instead: 
info_dhs_datasets &amp;lt;- read_csv(file = paste0(path_git_repo, &amp;quot;/DHS_region_harmonization_files/info_dhs_dataset.csv&amp;quot;))
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   SurveyId = col_character(),
##   SurveyYear = col_double(),
##   DHS_CountryCode = col_character(),
##   CountryName = col_character(),
##   zip_file_name = col_character(),
##   rds_file_name = col_character()
## )

# Dataframe the infos on only the surveys you are interested in 
file_names_one_country &amp;lt;- info_dhs_datasets %&amp;gt;% 
  dplyr::filter(DHS_CountryCode == country_code) %&amp;gt;% 
  dplyr::select(rds_file_name, SurveyYear, SurveyId)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 - Load all of the survey datasets you need and select your variables
of interest. Make sure your selection includes the variable region (v024
if the survey is after 1989, v101 otherwise). Again, I recommend to use
the package &lt;em&gt;rdhs&lt;/em&gt; to be able to load your DHS data in the RDS format.
Please note that in this document I am using toy data and not the real
DHS dataset of Benin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;
# Load the dhs survey with RDS
country_dhs_survey_data &amp;lt;- data.frame()

for(i in 1:nrow(file_names_one_country)) { # this loops over all the DHS surveys available for ONE country. 
  
  current_dhs_survey_data &amp;lt;- 
    readRDS(file =paste0(path_toy_dhs_data, &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;, file_names_one_country$rds_file_name[i])) %&amp;gt;%
    dplyr::select(
      v024, # variable name of the DHS district /!\ if the survey is from 1989 or before the region name is v101, not v024
      v119, v106, v012) %&amp;gt;% # select your variable of interest. Here: electricity, highest education level and age
  dplyr::rename(region_num_raw = v024) %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(survey_id = file_names_one_country$SurveyId[i]) # add the corresponding survey id
  
  region_labels &amp;lt;- stack(attr(current_dhs_survey_data$region_num_raw, &#39;labels&#39;)) %&amp;gt;% # get labels and index correspondance
    as.data.frame() %&amp;gt;% 
    rename(region_num_raw = values, # rename them to match it the DHS region harmonization dataset
         region_name_raw = ind)
  
  # Join the region_labels dataframe with our dhs surveys, to get the raw region name 
  current_dhs_survey_data &amp;lt;- current_dhs_survey_data %&amp;gt;% left_join(region_labels, by = &amp;quot;region_num_raw&amp;quot;)
  current_dhs_survey_data$region_num_raw &amp;lt;- as.numeric(as.character(current_dhs_survey_data$region_num_raw))
  
  country_dhs_survey_data &amp;lt;- rbind(country_dhs_survey_data, # bind the current dhs data to previous ones
                                   current_dhs_survey_data)
  
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the DHS data look like BEFORE the region harmonization, for
only one region of Benin
2017:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go! You now have all the DHS datasets in which you are
interested with their region name harmonized from one year to another.
This allows you for example to create a panel dataset easily: you’ll
just have to aggregate the data at the regional (i.e. district) level,
and you will have repeated measures over time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This dataset is “home made” and I do not guarantee it is
flawless. If you have any question, report of errors, please contact me
or make a pull request!&lt;/p&gt;
